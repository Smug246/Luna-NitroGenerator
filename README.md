  Luna Nitro Generator is a tool that allows you to create nitro codes and check if they are valid or invalid!
</h2>




## 🐍・ Download Python

Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to start off if you don't have it already!
```sh-session
python v3.10.1 or higher
```

### 1. Download The NitroGen.py File:
```
Download the file then open it with either cmd or python launcher.
```

### 2. Input Amount Of Codes
```
This is self explanatory, just type an amount you'd like to check.
I'd recommend 5000+.
```
### 3. Input Webhook
```
You will now be prompted to input your webhook. This is so valid codes
can be sent to the webhook so you can instantly claim them. Once you've 
done this press enter.
```
### 4. Code Checking
```
100s of codes will be created and checked. Most will be invalid but there is 
a small chance a code will be generated.
```
### 5. Your Welcome, Enjoy!
